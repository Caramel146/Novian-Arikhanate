 # leader_trait_governor_novian_desc:0 "This leader is equipped with precursor military cybernetics that, among other things, can devise counter-terrorism operations based on intel gathered from uplinks to surveillance systems, as well as provide running assessments of the standings of notable power brokers... and if necessary, means of sabotage."
 # leader_trait_scientist_novian:0 "$leader_trait_admiral_novian$"
 # leader_trait_scientist_novian_desc:0 "This leader has been heavily augmented with cybernetic implants, which, among other things, seemlessly integrate low-level AI directly into neural activity, drastically increasing cognitive capabilities. Generative capabilities of the AI use training sets compiled entirely from military research."
 # leader_trait_ruler_novian:0 "$leader_trait_admiral_novian$"
 # leader_trait_ruler_novian_desc:0 "This leader has been heavily augmented with precursor military cybernetics that, among other things, have vast suites of programs to assist in assessing the galactic political landscape, maintaining long-term hegemony, conducting espionage, and managing wartime logistics."
 leader_trait_novian:0 "Novian Military Augments"
 leader_trait_novian_desc:0 "This leader is equipped with first-class military cybernetics from a technologically advanced, but rabidly violent precursor civilization. They not only enhance cognition, but also carry extensive archives of knowledge and myriad sophisticated programs."

 trait_novian_assembly:0 "Cybernetic Overcompatibility"
 trait_novian_assembly_desc:0 "§RThis species' biology has been genetically engineered to be unnaturally receptive to cybernetic augmentation, to the extent of accepting nanotech implants in the fetal stage without immune system rejection. This, however, trades-off with a weakened immune system without supplementation with in-vitro augmentations, making natural reproduction more difficult.§!"

 #Initial Investigations event locs
 novian.3001.name:0 "Novian Investigations"
 novian.3001.desc:0 "The advanced and aggressive Novian Arikhanate presents a potential grave threat to our nation, demanding high-priority intelligence analysis. Every move they make that we know of will be documented. This information will be critical if they are to §Pattack§! us in the future, which is highly likely given the xenophobic militarism evident in our limited communications with them.\n\nThere is also great opportunity for scientific, historical and technological insight in studying them: their civilisation is a living fossil given their age and apparent stagnation, presenting a rare opportunity to see the past in detail."
 novian.3001.a:0 "Lets get to work then."

 novian.10001.name:0 "Novian Technology Study Complete"
 novian.10001.desc:0 "From the data our scientists and probes have been able to gather, Novian technology is highly advanced. However, similar to most precursor civilizations, it is not without its flaws. Most of their technology seems to be made for centuries with little maintenance - likely due to their civilization going into stasis for long periods for a currently unknown reason - but despite going to such lengths, it is showing the consequences of decay."
 novian.10001.a:0 "Interesting."

 novian.10002.name:0 "Novian Culture Investigation Complete"
 novian.10002.desc:0 "The Novian race differs greatly from the convergent evolutionary models that define most other galactic species, relying on unconventional biochemistries not usually seen in all but the most exotic extremophilic lifeforms. This allows them to live on worlds considered toxic by others, where they live in subterranean colonies and possess almost complete control over the biospheres. However, they struggle to survive on most other worlds without substantial life support equipment. \n\nThey are extremely distrusting of each other but even more so aliens, and their culture places a great emphasis on preventing themselves from 'going soft,' despite a clear economic reliance on xeno slaves. Each slave race appears to have been put towards specific tasks, such as the pre-eminent race of Sektians being focused towards farming and mining."
 novian.10002.a:0 "Worrying."

 novian.10003.name:0 "Novian Engineering Analysis Complete"
 novian.10003.desc:0 "Our study of Novian engineering has concluded that they make use of higher dimensional engineering due to the sheer stress put on their constructs from the sizes and energies involved. According to a team of our engineers, their structures are figuratively 'held together by gigastructural duct tape, xeno-based glue, and some hope and zealotry.' \n\n They appear to be meeting the energy demands of such inefficient technology by extracting energy from the hyperquasar at the center of the galaxy. If we were somehow able to cut off this source, we would undoubtedly throw much of their civilization into disarray."
 novian.10003.a:0 "Intriguing."

 #event for finishing all special projects
 novian.10004.name:0 "The Bigger Fish"
 novian.10004.desc:0 "The Arikhanate appears to place extreme emphasis on a singular ship - and for good reason. The Hypership is among the largest warships, let alone singular assets, that we are aware of in galactic history. Being built in part around a star, it eclipses some entire systems.\n\n It seems to act as the flagship of the Arikhanate, being its prized possession and the tool sent against only the Arikhan's greatest perceived threats. Such a fight would be a daunting task for even some of the most powerful galactic forces, and its sheer scale strikes dread into the hearts and minds of our officers."
 novian.10004.a:0 "Alarming."

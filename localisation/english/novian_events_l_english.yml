 novian.2000.desc:0 "Preliminary scans of the Galactic Core prior to the discovery of its hyperlanes had predicted that it would be completely devoid of any intelligent lifeforms, as we failed to detect any traces of artificial radio-waves or other elements pointing towards the existence of an advanced civilization residing there.\n\nHowever, as the first few explorer probes began heading into the newly-revealed core, they started picking up faint yet persistent signals emanating from the region around the core itself. Originally assumed to be from the supermassive black hole at the very center of the galaxy, these signals only intensified in both strength and complexity before the explorer probes were finally shot down by what seemed to be some sort of automated defense system.\n\nBefore our scientists were even able to formulate theories as to how or why our scanners somehow missed an entire civilization residing within the galactic core, sensors across the galaxy picked up an extremely powerful subspace transmission coming from the edges of the central cluster.\n\nWhoever these mysterious beings residing within the core might be, they are now addressing the rest of the galaxy directly..."

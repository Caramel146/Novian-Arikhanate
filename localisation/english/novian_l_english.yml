This star's corona is violent and chaotic, making coronal mass ejections commonplace and exceptionally destructive, although orbiting planets towards the edge of the system seem to be mostly spared. The star also rotates with such speed and force that it mimicks the polar electromagnetic emissions of a pulsar."

 sm_ring_giga_novian_logistics_desc: "This facility of the Arikhanate provides immense ship dockyards and crew provisions, extending their already long arm to dish out punishment to those who oppose it." #It is from this variety of dry docks that the Arikian state is capable of sustaining its fleets. Massive PsykoConveyors pump the much needed supplies and personnel into the organs of vessels, enabling a single Arikian module to sustain a great deal more vessels than conventional technology would.

 #events triggered by completing special projects
 giga_novian.3001.name:0 "Novian Intelligence Agency"
 giga_novian.3001.desc:0 "The discovery of the Novian Arikhanate will certainly pose a threat to our nation. It will be necessary to form an agency dedicated to the study and collection of information related to the Novians. Every move they make that we know of will be catalogued and studied. There is great opportunity for scientific, cultural, and military gain by studying them considering how old their civilization is, a very rare and unique opportunity in this galaxy. Studying the Novians will be very beneficial in the long run, especially if they were to §Pattack§! us in the future, which is highly likely considering the data we have gathered from the limited communications we've had with them and their xenophobic nature."
 giga_novian.3001.a:0 "Lets get to work then."
 giga_novian.10001.name:0 "Novian Technology Study Complete"
 giga_novian.10001.desc:0 "From what our scientists and the limited data our probes have been able to gather Novian technology is highly advanced. However, similar to most precursor civilizations, it is not without its flaws. Most of their technology seems to be made for war as well as lasting for centuries with little maintenance, likely due to their civilization going into stasis for long periods for a currently unknown reason. Despite going to such lengths, it is showing the consequences of such little maintenance."
 giga_novian.10001.a:0 "Interesting."
 giga_novian.10002.name:0 "Novian Culture Investigation Complete"
 giga_novian.10002.desc:0 "The Novian race differs greatly from the convergent evolutionary models that define most other galactic species, relying on unconventional biomolecules and chemistries not usually seen in all but the most exotic extremophilic lifeforms.  This makes them very rugged, surviving on worlds most other species would never consider, usually living in subterranean colonies, and posses almost complete control over the local biospheres of their own worlds.  However, they are unable to survive on most other worlds without substantial life support equipment. \n\nTheir culture has been shaped significantly by this, with great emphasis on preventing themselves from 'going soft,' and a large reliance on slaves from 'primitive races.'  Each of these races appears to have been put towards specific tasks within the Novian Arikhanate, such as their largest slave population of Sektians being focused towards farming and mining.  They are extremely xenophobic and distrusting of outsiders, and often overlook their slaves as anything more than a tool."
 giga_novian.10002.a:0 "Worrying."
 giga_novian.10003.name:0 "Novian Engineering Analysis Complete"
 giga_novian.10003.desc:0 "After the conclusion of our study of Novian engineering it has been concluded that some Novian ships make very limited use of higher dimensional engineering due to the sheer stress put on their constructs from their size. According to a few of our engineers their structures are figuratively 'held together by gigastructural duct tape, xeno based glue, and some hope and zealotry.' They appear to be meeting the energy demands of such advanced technology by §Sextracting energy from the hyperquasar at the center of the galaxy§!. If we were somehow able to get access to this, we would undoubtedly be able to throw much of their civilization into disarray, however such an attack would be very costly."

 #event for finishing all special projects
 giga_novian.10004.name:0 "The Bigger Fish"
 giga_novian.10004.desc:0 "The Arikhate appears to place extreme emphasis on a singular ship - and for good reason.  The Hypership is the largest and most dangerous threat, let alone singular asset, that we are aware of in galactic history.  Being built in part around a star, it eclipses some entire systems.  It seems to act as the flagship of the Arikhanate, being its prized possession and the tool sent against only the Arikhan's greatest perceived threats.  Such a fight would be a daunting task for even some of the most powerful galactic forces, and its sheer scale strikes fear into the hearts and minds of our officers."
